        <p>
          Hi, my name is Jakub Folejtar and I am a 27 years old developer from
          Prague. I live in Karlin with my wife, son and a cat. To be a
          developer is not only a job for me, but rather a passion. I also like
          to take up on a challenge and enjoy being perfectionist about my work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My interests towards programming started when I was around 12 years
          old. The first spark was set by my older brother who at that time was
          already full time coder, doing his magic in html and css and partially
          in Flash (R.I.P.). I picked up on those skills and tried to hone them,
          I was trying to code something all the time, and in my young mind,
          stupid ideas were flowing all the time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I was attending a general high school, with no specific direction set
          to continue afterwards. So I decided it would be best, at 15, to
          switch to a more specific high school that specialises in programming.
          I started attending SPŠE Ječná and graduated there after 4 years. I
          did not really enjoy the school as the kind of stuff they were
          teaching were quickly getting obsolete and new technologies were
          coming out every now and then, so I had to catch up and learn on my
          own.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          After graduating, I jumped straight into university (ČVUT FIT) to
          further enhance my programming skills, but after half a year I dropped
          out. The reason was that I am not the most patient person when it
          comes to things without direction, and this school felt like it first
          needs to teach me tons of stuff around programming before actually
          getting to actuall programming. I continued on learning on my own,
          possibly missing on some interesting stuff, but I was master of my own
          time this way. I wanted to start getting more experience in the
          industry by actually working for some company, so I created a profile
          on job searching platform and tried to ask for a job. This resulted in
          my first real job experience in Socialbakers a.s.

        <h2>2014-2015 Socialbakers a.s. (Developer)</h2>
        <p>
          I started my career here as a junior support developer. My job was to
          handle or distribute technical requests coming to customer support. I
          was able to use this as a starting point of my learning curve.
        </p>
        <h2>2015-2015 E-commerce Holding a.s. (Developer)</h2>
        <p>
          Since there was a so called black Friday in Socialbakers due to lack
          of financial assets, I was fired as my junior position was not a
          necessity for the company. I searched for a new job, and for short
          period of time I settled in E-commerce Holding a.s. working on a
          project that should result in a framework able to create e-shops in
          minutes.
        </p>
        <h2>2015-2019 Socialbakers a.s. (Developer)</h2>
        <p>
          After some reconsideration from Socialbakers, they came up with offer
          to get back to the company, since I already spent quite some time
          learning the exact processes there, and was in a way a good asset, as
          I was eager to work quite fast and resolve lot of issues before they
          needed to be handled by other teams. This time, I was hired on 2
          positions simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          One as the original support developer, the other as a data analyst and
          data provider for different needs across the whole company.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In 2017, after gathering some experience I joined different team, that
          was focused solely on programming, specifically grabbing data from
          social networks, mapping and enriching them to our needs, and saving
          them to different places as well per needs of the product. In this
          team I learned a lot about APIs, backend programming in PHP and after
          the migration, about Node-js. It was a great journey with a lot of
          challenge to overcome, as each API behaves differently, releases new
          version often, has unexpected issues in the production run that needs
          to be resolved ASAP. According to the last sentence, in this team I
          also had to take maintenance duty overnight from time to time.
        </p>
        <h2>2019-2020 Socialbakers a.s. (Product Owner)</h2>
        <p>
          This all was alredy getting quite stereotypical, so I decided I need a
          change and joined a Product team as a Product Owner for the same team
          I was part of until now. The team was actually kind of company within
          company, so it made sense it had a 1:1 relation with it's Product
          owner. This was a really interesting experience which gave me insight
          from the other perspective, so I was able to pick up on some
          diplomatic skills and also was more able to see problems from
          different point of views. However, it was not meant for me as I was
          missing the rewarding feeling of completing a programming task, which
          you can have on almost daily basis as a programmer, so I decided to
          step out once again.
        </p>
        <h2>2020-now Socialbakers a.s. (Developer)</h2>
        <p>
          Now I am back in the team I was Product Owner for, so back in the old
          track, however with new view and better motivation to develop once
          again.
